### Method overloading is the process of giving a single method name multiple definitions in a class
- If a method is overloaded, the method name is not sufficient to determine which method is being called
- The **signature** of each overloaded method must be unique
- The signature includes the number, type, and order of the parameters

#### The return type of the method is not part of the signature
- Overloaded methods cannot differ only by their return type
#### Constructors can be overloaded
- Overloaded constructors provide multiple ways to initialize a new object
