# Interfaces 
- An interface is a completely **"abstract class"** that is used to group related methods with empty bodies.
- An abstract method is a method header without a method body
- A Java interface is a collection of abstract methods and constants
- An interface cannot be **instantiated**
-  Methods in an interface have **public visibility by default**
- If a class declares that it implements an interface, it must define **all methods** in the interface.
- In addition to (or instead of) abstract methods, an interface can contain constants When a class implements an interface, it gains access to all its constants
